# Jupyter notebooks with JSBSim use cases 

A set of Jupyter notebooks to show how JSBSim can be used for engineering simulations. The notebooks are based on the JSBSim interface for Python 3, i.e. the same that we use for unit testing.

# Spread sheets

A set of spread sheets in the [Open Document format](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/) is provided to give more details on how some data used in JSBSim has been computed.

# Doxygen files

The files `DoxygenLayout.xml` and `JSBSim.dox.in` contain the instructions to customize and build JSBSim documentation with [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).
